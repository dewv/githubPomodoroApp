# Win Conditions of Success-Critical Stakeholders

> Making winners of the system's key stakeholders is a neccessary and sufficient condition for project success.

The goal of this document is to record:
1. all stakeholders who are critical to the project's success,
2. all "win conditions" for each of these stakeholders, and
3. evidence that it is feasible to build a system that satisfies the entire set of win conditions.

## Stakeholder 1: DevOps (CEO)

### Win condition 1.1: To have pomodoro system set up to keep track of the work. 

for each pomodoro started: who? was it finished? what GH Issue? (should be open, assigned to person) support estimation (later) data integrity (probably means relying on our own db, not just GH comments)

Students for the students the win condition is for the system to be easy to use.

## Stakeholder 2: DevOps (Staff)

### Win condition 2.1: To have a way to log time that is easy to use

## Feasability

Most of the system will reuse technical tools and components used before; we know it is feasible to build systems this way. The main area of feasability risk is integration with GitHub.
