# Project Documents

This folder is for documents related to project management, design documentation, etc.

In general, changes to the documents in this folder should be made as follows.
1. Use a git branch named `projectDocs`.
2. Put `[ci skip] ` at the beginning of all commit messages, to prevent triggering a test build in the CI tools.
3. Submit a Pull Request. The CODEOWNERS setting should automatically assign the CEO to review it. (You probably have permission to merge your PR, but please don't.)
