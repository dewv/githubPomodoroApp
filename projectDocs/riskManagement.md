# Risk Management

*At least* once each week, the project manager should update this document according to the instructions that follow. Update more frequently when appropriate.

## Risk assessment

Review the list below and enter "Yes" or "No" to indicate which categories have acceptable levels of risk.

| Risk category | Is this a significant risk |
| ---- | ---- |
| investing too many or too few resources | Yes |
| missing success-critical stakeholders      | No |
| missing win conditions      | No |
| conflicting win conditions      | No |
| too much or too little quality assurance work      | Yes |
| too much or too little requirements definition      | No |
| too much or too little design definition      | No |
| too much or too little implementation work      | Yes |
| too much or too little deployment planning      | Yes |
| deploying too late or too soon      | Yes |

## Risk mitigation

Add a row below the headings of the following table (so that the most recent information is at the top). In the new row, record the date, and *brief* plans to mitigate the most critical risk(s). 

Mitigation plans are steps that *you* will take *this week*, and probably today. Some examples:

- Assign staff to improve requirements documentation
- Continue implementing service X
- Place implementation tasks on hold
- Propose cancelling the project

The most critical risk(s) are the first appearance(s) of "No" in the table above. 

| Date | Mitigation plans |
| ---- | ---------------- |
