# End of Semester Info for _Github Pomodoro App_

### 12.6.18 (Fall 2018)
#### Manager: Jonathan Stanley 

+ Numerous issues for Pomodoro were created through the Fall 2018 semester to setup for work to be done.

+ Due to the fresh start from the code aspect the project is at the most part bare bones in terms of work progress on code.

+ Obtaining staff to work on issues was scarce due to the presence of the other 2 projects.

+ One large area of concern as far as definition goes is for how  Github will successfully work in entirety with the app. Much research still needs
completed, especially in light of the new framework.

+ Work that was done is stuck on the `pomodoroModel` branch currently. As of the time of this report there is a open pull
request to `master` which will not pass test because of incomplete code. 

+ Towards the end of the semester I started creating a version of projectDocs in the form of a project board. [Click here to view _Project Board_](https://github.com/dewv/githubPomodoroApp/projects/1).
This project board provides a good visualization of the issues & their status.
